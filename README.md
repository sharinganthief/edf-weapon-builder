It is highly reccomended to download this via [git](https://git-scm.com/download/win) while it is still under rapid development for easy updating.
If you don't know how to do that:
1. install git
2. go to the folder where you'd like the program to be
3. right click somewhere empty in the folder and choose "git bash here"
4. paste "git clone https://Big-Racer@bitbucket.org/Big-Racer/edf-weapon-builder.git" without the quotes (you may have to right click)
5. whenever you want to update, either run update and run.bat or use git bash and "git pull https://Big-Racer@bitbucket.org/Big-Racer/edf-weapon-builder.git"



Requires a [Python 3+ installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Tested with Python 3.8, certain packages have been included in the repo
 for convenience. After installing python, double click on main.py. Currently requires [sgott.exe and the EDF ModLoader.](https://github.com/zeddidragon/sgott/releases/tag/v1.6.0)
 
This currently assumes you have experience modding weapons and are set up to do so. Instructions on how to do so will be written at a later time.
