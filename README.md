# README #

Requires a [Python 3+ installation](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Tested with Python 3.8, certain packages have been included in the repo
 for convenience. After installing python, double click on main.py. Currently requires [sgott.exe and the EDF ModLoader.](https://github.com/zeddidragon/sgott/releases/tag/v1.6.0)
 
 This currently assumes you have experience modding weapons and are set up to do so. Instructions on how to do so will be written at a later time.

Contact Big Racer#2799 on the EDF discord with any issues or new value documentation. https://discord.gg/6kqZUc7
